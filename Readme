Secure Login and Registration System
Overview
This is a full-stack web application built to demonstrate a secure and efficient user authentication and data management system. It features a complete user lifecycle, from registration and login to a personalized dashboard where users can perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their data. The system is built with a focus on modern security practices and is designed to be easily set up in a local development environment.


Features
1. User Authentication
Registration: Secure new user account creation.

Login: Session-based authentication to verify user credentials.

Access Control: Restricts dashboard and CRUD functionality to authenticated users only.

2. Database Interaction
PDO (PHP Data Objects): Utilizes PDO for secure and efficient database connections.

Prepared Statements: Prevents SQL injection attacks by separating SQL queries from user data.

3. CRUD Operations
Dashboard: A secure dashboard that serves as the central hub for data management.

Create: Functionality to add new records.

Read: Displays user-specific data in a clean, organized table.

Update: Allows users to modify existing records.

Delete: Securely removes records after a confirmation prompt.

4. Security Measures
Password Hashing: Passwords are never stored in plain text. password_hash() is used for hashing and password_verify() for verification.

XSS Protection: User inputs and outputs are sanitized and escaped to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

Session Management: Secure sessions are used for user authentication, with built-in timeouts and secure cookie handling.

5. Form Handling
POST Requests: All sensitive data submissions (login, registration, updates) are handled via secure POST requests.

Input Validation: Robust server-side validation is implemented to ensure data integrity and security.



Technologies Used
PHP: The backend logic is built using PHP 8.

Framework: The system leverages a PHP framework such as Laravel for its robust structure and built-in security features.

Front-End: The front-end styling is powered by Bootstrap 5 to provide a clean, responsive, and modern user interface.

Database: A MySQL database is used for data persistence.
